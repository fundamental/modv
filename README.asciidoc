Module VHDL
-----------

Module VHDL or modv is an experiment in rewriting the syntax of VHDL.
Due to VHDL's ADA heritage, the syntax tends to be verbose, obscuring the
meaning of code at some times.
The overall new syntax takes inspiration from ruby's minimalism with an
emphasis on blocks for describing designs

Building
~~~~~~~~

modv is built with cmake and can be built by running:

------------------------------------------------------
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
------------------------------------------------------

This should produce the modv compiler, which currently takes arguments in the
form of "modv input-modv-file output-vhdl-file"

What Is Being Done
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Grammar is mostly complete
* Parsing works, but suffers from dangling else issues
* Code Generation works, but needs more extensive tests
* No semantics analysis is done, basic work should be done here to indicate
  programmatic errors before VHDL files are passed on to another tool
